<p>Well, at least I know my workflow in GitHub Actions is triggering now. I went to look at the logging and found that the build was failing with an error.</p>

<p>“No repo name found. Specify using PAGES_REPO_NWO environment variables, ‘repository’ in your configuration, or set up an ‘origin’ git remote pointing to your github.com repository.”</p>

<h2 id="google-search">Google Search</h2>
<p>A quick search for the error shows that I should be able to just add a repository value to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> like this for my repo  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repository: jr101dallas/jr101dallas.github.io</code> and it should be all better. I guess I’ll know in a couple minutes.</p>

<h2 id="tripped-over">Tripped Over</h2>
<p>While I was there, I also noticed that the tag for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author</code> had been mispelled “auhor” so maybe I also found the problem with the author line in my Posts layout. Happy day, right? Also, definitely a great example of lived in code. Working around in the code and actually looking when I do things helps to catch the stuff that I haven’t gone looking for. A million more years and commits and it should be perfect.</p>
