<h1 id="bummer">Bummer</h1>
<p>According to the logging, GitHub Actions is running my workflow according to schedule. However, I don’t see the next post showing on <a href="https://assumeforsimplicity.com">assumeforsimplicity.com</a> and I was really hoping I had the problem solved. I’m going to hold off pushing through tomorrow and see if maybe I just still have something I’m not thinking of correctly in the timestamps before I invalidate the testing again.</p>

<h2 id="although">Although..</h2>
<p>I’ve also taken the opportunity to stop and test whether I can properly add images to my posts. I probably don’t want to go crazy with images, but it’s nice to be able to illustrate a point with fewer words. So, if I’ve done this correctly, you should see an image of the GitHub Actions logging. I know, exciting, right?</p>

<h2 id="double-checking">Double Checking</h2>
<p>Now a little save, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code> and we’ll know for sure. You can hold your breath, I won’t finish this post before I have it working… probably.</p>

<h2 id="crash-and-recover">Crash and Recover</h2>
<p>It wasn’t quite as easy as I had hoped, possibly because of the theme I’ve chosen. It sounds like some themes may be a little more full featured than others. But, with some reseach and mangling together of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54157109/how-to-render-background-image-in-a-page-generated-by-jekyll/54166941">things</a>, I’ve got a workable solution. The link got me what I needed to know about the proper html, and the right placement in my posts layout, and the switch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page.background</code> possibly poorly named, was my addition to my front matter. That way, a post that needs no picture, or a different one, doesn’t have to suffer sameness. I may have to do some research on small image sizes….</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"hero"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
