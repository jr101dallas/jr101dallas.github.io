<h1 id="search-first">Search First</h1>
<p>I’m really wanting to quick put up some categoty pages, partly because it’s going to help me with summarizing my posts on the website configuration into a nice how-to, but also because it seems like a nice bow to tie up the work I’ve just been doing. So, search the web and find <a href="https://www.azurepatterns.com/2020/03/11/jekyll-categories">Brent McConnell</a> who has some good code on setting up simple category pages in jekyll with the basic GitHub Pages allowed plugins.</p>

<h2 id="remix">Remix</h2>
<p>I didn’t quite want what he’s done, but starting with his layout and shoehorn in what is basically my current Posts page layout, and I’ve got the layout I want more or less. I’ve only got three categories so his other code was a little much. I just created the folders that my posts in the category will land in and created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code> files in them, skipping the permalinks. Then, since I’ve got no sidebars, I scrounged the logic out of the category listing and put it at the top of my <a href="/posts/">Posts</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="touchups">Touchups</h2>
<p>While I was in there, I grabbed the link style from my Last Post link and added a “Back to Posts” at the top of the category layout and the post layout. Nothing all that fancy but I feel like the navigation is better now. Hooray! And, now I have my easy list for my <a href="/roguelike/">roguelike</a> category. Just six posts, a little depressing. The <a href="/website/">website</a> has sixteen posts in it and I wish it didn’t. The website is definitely necessary for where I’m trying to go, but I’m trying not to let it be the point.</p>
