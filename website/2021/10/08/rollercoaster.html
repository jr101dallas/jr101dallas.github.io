<h1 id="broken-cname">Broken CNAME</h1>
<p>Apparently my broken Custom Domain setting for my GitHub Pages is still a thing. I found a page that indicated that this can be caused by a force push. It is possible that is exactly what my GitHub Action is doing and maybe most of the people using it don’t have custom domains.</p>

<h2 id="combined-learning">Combined Learning</h2>
<p>Maybe, with what I’ve finally learned with this whole adventure, I can find a different action that will work or maybe I go back to the original action that I found and see if I actually do need what it’s got. I’ll kick around some research a bit here and see what I come up with and let you know below.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>I guess I should have read more of the documentation. There was a reminder at the bottom that if I’m using a branch other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>, and I’m now using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code>, then I need to manually create and commit a CNAME file to it. That at least appears to have fixed the immediate problem, but I’m curious about when the workflow runs in the GitHub Actions. I found some switches that appear to keep the history on the branch, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keep_history</code> on the Jekyll action, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keep_files</code> in the Jekyll <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> that maybe also need to be set. I think I’m setting them now and hope it’s not overkill to keep the CNAME file from the config settings. I’ll let you know how it works out….</p>

<p>UPDATE: This wasn’t the real answer either. I don’t think I saw the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keep</code> settings above work the way I expected but it was way easier than that. The real answer is <a href="/website/2021/10/09/oh-duh.html">here</a>.</p>
