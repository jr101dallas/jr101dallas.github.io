<a href="/posts/">&#8672;&nbsp;Back to Posts</a>


<h1 id="jekyll-example">Jekyll Example</h1>
<p>For my Posts <a href="/posts/">page</a> I’ve just been using the basic example from the Jekyll <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#:~:text=Creating%20an-,index%20of%20posts,-on%20another%20page">documentation</a>. It’s been a good start since it let me see when things are being published easily. But.. I think I’d like to show the dates, and I might want to see about breaking them up into groups.</p>

<h2 id="showing-dates">Showing Dates</h2>
<p>It seems like showing the date should be pretty easy since I know the Liquid and templating should just show <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post.date</code> like it shows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post.title</code> but I’m betting I’m going to want different formatting.</p>

<p>Yeah, a minor change and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve --future</code> later and definitely the format is a problem. It looks like this, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2021-09-16 11:18:09 -0500 Reorganizing</code>, so I’m going to need to do some research.</p>

<h2 id="date-format-solution">Date Format Solution</h2>
<p>I found a <a href="https://help.looker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023800253-Easy-Date-Formatting-with-Liquid">page</a> with what I needed for the date formatting at least. With some playing around with the formatting I finally got what I wanted.</p>

<h2 id="grouping">Grouping</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I’ve also run out of time and I’ll have to takle the grouping by month later.</p>
