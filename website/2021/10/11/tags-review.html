<h1 id="looking-back">Looking Back</h1>
<p>In preparing to look back through my posts in order to organize my thoughts and tag posts as the groups become more obvious, I realized that I’d never done anything with previous and next posts. Annoying to try to flip through the posts for sure.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>A quick search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll posts next button</code> got some hits and I settlted on part of the solution from <a href="https://www.bytedude.com/jekyll-previous-and-next-posts/">bytedude</a> and grabbed his final html/liquid for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post.html</code> and skipped the css part since I haven’t branched out of the default in the tactile theme yet and don’t have any checked in .css files. When I later find how broken this decision was and mend the error of my ways I’ll look him up and tell him how right he was.</p>

<h2 id="scanning">Scanning</h2>
<p>Next is a matrix deja vu on my posts most likely, I’ll probably find a few things that I’m not happy with along the way and research fixes. But, as I tag things, I should also be able to put together the concise how-to on my website configuration so people don’t have to read the drivel to get there.</p>
