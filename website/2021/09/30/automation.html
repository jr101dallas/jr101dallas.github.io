<h1 id="github-actions">GitHub Actions</h1>
<p>It’s time to see if I can get the code running that <a href="https://seankilleen.com/2020/02/how-to-deploy-github-pages-on-a-schedule-to-publish-future-posts/">Sean Killeen</a> posted about. I’m thinking that I’m about to have a pause in my regular time blocks that I’ve been using on this project, so having the actions running regularly to publish the formerly future posts would be advantageous.</p>

<h2 id="soactually">So…actually</h2>
<p>When I save myself a breadcrumb like this, I know that a solution exists, and I just keep working on whatever I’m busy with until something actually catches fire. Being that I now have some smoke, I went back to the solution I knew existed and took a look. Like frequently happens, I’ve had some time to think and I took another shot at searching. I found some interesting things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>GitHub Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#:~:text=trigger%20a%20workflow%20at%20a%20scheduled%20time">documentation</a></li>
  <li>a GitHub Pages <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action">Action</a></li>
  <li>and a suggested workflow for Jekyll when I clicked into my repository Actions tab</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="adding-two-and-two-hopefully">Adding Two and Two Hopefully</h2>
<p>Where I’ve ended up for the moment is this. The recommended Jekyll GitHub Action, plus the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">schedule</code> example from the GitHubActions documentation, to get the following contents in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll.yml</code> in the root of my repository. I’ll test it over the next couple of days by only commiting locally and not pushing to GitHub. If it’s working then I should see assumeforsimplicity.com get updated anyway after 11:30 AM whatever time the servers run on.</p>
