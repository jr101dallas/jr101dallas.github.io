<p>When I started with this project, my user GitHub Pages, I was planning to write a lot about business. I’m still planning to do that, but I’ve gotten side tracked some in the details of getting things really up and running on less than an hour a day.</p>

<p>Right now, in Oct. 2021, I’m a calendar month or so into the project, closing in on one work-week of work time. If you’re laughing, you probably know what I mean. But, that also means that I’m not the only person out there trying to put together a project on little time and trying to keep focus and be efficient, and <strong>THAT</strong> is the main point of this site.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-no-time">Working with No Time</h2>
<p>If I can get this project going on an hour a day, not lose track, not burn out, and keep momentum, then I’ll have a great example for the habit, the algorithm, I’m trying to demonstrate. That is, that arranging your work and habits in a certain way can keep you on track for your business <strong>even though you don’t have time</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="roguelike-tutorial">Roguelike Tutorial</h4>
<p>The initial object, work item, I’m working on putting together is a <a href="/roguelike-tutorial/">roguelike game and tutorial</a>. The intention is both to demonstrate the habit above but also to demonstrate certain arrangement of code to keep things moving long term in a software project. Notably, demonstration of some of the common tutorial things like Object Oriented Programming (OOP) or the libraries I’m using will be missing.</p>

<h4 id="blog">Blog</h4>
<p>Along the way, I’m jabbering my way through my work in the <a href="/posts/">blog</a> and realizing that although some people will find that interesting and entertaining, others will be wanting a distilled versions of certain aspects of the journey, like how I’ve got the website set up. That’s a future project at the moment but it may be a near future one since I think I’ve finally got it where I need it to be so that my <strong>life</strong> runs the way it needs to run and the <strong>website</strong> runs the way it needs to run even though those two things are completely different in schedule and regularity. I do have some <a href="/permalink/website-setup">notes</a> now on what I needed to know about the website setup.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>See <a href="/breadcrumbs/">Breadcrumbs</a> if you’re just trying to figure out what’s supposed to be happening or <a href="/business/2021/09/12/following-breadcrumbs.html">Following Breadcrumbs</a> if you want to see some blather on “What the heck? Breadcrumbs?”</p>

<p>Or, feel free to rummage around in <a href="/posts/">Posts</a> for spare change and the like.</p>
