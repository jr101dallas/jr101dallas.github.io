# Hooray!
Found this after writing the last post. Looks like GitHub Actions do indeed offer an avenue for triggering a build of the Jekyll logic that will then render posts dated recently in the past but in the future with respect to the last build.

## Plan to Try, but not Now
I'll have to try this out in a bit. [Sean Killeen](sean-killeen) posted that that an action using a container that installs curl can then execute a curl script utilizing a a repository secret that you've loaded with a personal access token to hit the GitHub API and trigger the build. Which, is what I need to have happen. I might not necessarily stick to that script, but if you can do it that way then pretty much your language and tool of choice should work.

## Relief
I'm not sure that I'd say that this project was in jeopardy without a way to regularly publish a backlog of work but there was a definite hiccup potential here. The point overall is a sustained momentum. Yes, in the Roguelike Tutorial but also in the overall, "I'm doing stuff." I've felt for a long time like this tutorial needed to happen, but also I've felt like I needed to get moving in general and as long as I can build momentum and take advantage of inertia, I intend to keep going even when I feel like the tutorial is complete. Hopefully I'll be doing this for a long time.
