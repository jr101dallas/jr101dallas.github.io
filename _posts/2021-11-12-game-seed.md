# Research
This is on my list of stuff to do, and I'm feeling interested in it today.  

- research games that allow setting the random seed

Digging into what games there are with user accessible random seed settings and how they're being used by game communities seems like it should be easy enough.

## Results
Maybe I'm not finding the right search terms but I'm not finding what I was thinking of with the Random Seed ideas in games. It looks to me like there's plenty of sharing of random seeds for starts in games like Minecraft or CivVI so that people can get the same cool maps, but I'm thinking about maybe even setting things up so that there are some things always tied to the seed, to get the same world, and then tying other things to a different random number generator so that "less unbalancing" things are still random and interesting.  

## Start a Plan
I think I'm going to revisit this a few times. I'm not ready to write a bunch of code around these concepts yet, so I don't have to make final decisions or find everything there is about it now. But, I feel like there's something interesting to do here with the game that would allow Players to share game experiences that are interesting, entertaining, or whatever.
