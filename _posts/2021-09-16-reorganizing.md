# Untangling
Getting things straightened out after discovering my first blind alley mistake has been a chance to think about where to put things. I really love digital projects because they're so malleable. When you decide you need a new window in the interior basement closet, you just go ahead and do it rather than meet with the reality of a laundry room between your closet in need of light and an outside wall. There are limits, but not that many.  

## Projects
Where I'm really getting down to is a tangle of multiple things. One part is a proof of concept for a business I'm working on with some friends. If I can get this into a decent place, then I can pretty easily support what that business may end up needing. Another part is a portfolio, that I don't currently have, so that if I end up interviewing or need some "street cred." to back up random bragging I have a [URL](afs) for the "I told you so."  

Also, I have an idea of a code project and tutorial series that I think would help a lot of people. I'll be making a roguelike game, because I want to do that anyway, but also I'll be doing the [tutorial](/roguelike-tutorial/), not to do a roguelike but to demonstrate a pile of things like [Unit Testing](ut) from the start, dipping toes into [Domain Driven Design](ddd), etc. There are some huge time saving strategies that a lot of the tutorials skip. Tutorials on Object Oriented, or the various libraries, or other very focused situations, tend to leave the person following the tutorial with a functional thing but painted into a corner on multiple fronts that stymie progress __beyond the tutorial__ and that's a shame.

More on that later.
