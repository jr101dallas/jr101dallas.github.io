# Cleanup
Luckily....  

I found a problem that I have evidently had for a long time with some of my links. I was using a variety of link styles, should have been consistent, and I had my [kramdown reference link][ref] syntax wrong. So that part is fixed, though I'm still working through the posts and adding categories.  

## Categories
I think when I'm finished I'm going to see what I can do about putting together some good category pages. I think I should just be able to write some Liquid on ```site.pages``` and output the posts on the page with the category that matches the category page. That way people can see an easy list of categories. I guess I'll add that to my [breadcrumbs](/breadcrumbs/).  

## Tags
I've also added tags. I'm not sure that I'll be able to as easily add tags pages as with the categories since the tags don't end up in their own folders, but I'll take a look at those too.  

## Spelling and Grammar
I've been kicking the can down the road on this one and I think I'm going to keep on doing it. The scanning of posts helped me catch a fair number of problems, so I know it definitely needs to be done, but it's just not movating me right now. Maybe tomorrow....
