# UTC
It appears that having my posts with date stamps in Chicago time clumped together some of my "daily" blog posts on the same day because of the timestamps being after midnight UTC. I didn't notice till after I added the date on the Posts page. It's a good addition visually and it also helped underline what was happening.  

## On Schedule
I'm not 100% sure if my GitHub Actions are actually working. Partly because I had an unreasonable expectation due to the timezone mismatch, and partly because each time I go look at the site I find something else that needs fixing up and I end up pushing the fixes. Maybe some day it'll be a work of art.  

## Move to Greenwich
I've just updated the timezone on my posts, find and replace -0600 with +0000 and pushed. Now the list on the Posts page at least looks right in terms of daily posts like I intended. Hopefully I'll also now have the right expectation for the next post to go up if my workflow on GitHub Actions is working.  

## Actually...
I just went looking to see if I could see any logging on the GitHub Actions workflow, and saw that I'd somehow not gotten my yaml file in the right folder to be recognized as a workflow. Ugh. Moved it now, maybe now I'll have some luck.
