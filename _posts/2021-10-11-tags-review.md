# Looking Back
In preparing to look back through my posts in order to organize my thoughts and tag posts as the groups become more obvious, I realized that I'd never done anything with previous and next posts. Annoying to try to flip through the posts for sure.  

## Research
A quick search for ```jekyll posts next button``` got some hits and I settlted on part of the solution from [bytedude][bytedude] and grabbed his final html/liquid for my ```post.html``` and skipped the css part since I haven't branched out of the default in the tactile theme yet and don't have any checked in .css files. When I later find how broken this decision was and mend the error of my ways I'll look him up and tell him how right he was.  

## Scanning
Next is a matrix deja vu on my posts most likely, I'll probably find a few things that I'm not happy with along the way and research fixes. But, as I tag things, I should also be able to put together the concise how-to on my website configuration so people don't have to read the drivel to get there.
