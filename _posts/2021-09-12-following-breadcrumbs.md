# Re-Starting
Life happens. Running a startup means interruptions. Sales calls, production incidents, other fun....

Sometimes it's just that priorities shift.

Leave yourself notes, breadcrumbs, leading back to where you were. Digital ones don't get eaten by birds... maybe bugs, if there are enough of them.

## Credentials
The first thing, most important, make a habit of saving credentials in a password vault. Save time on password resets for websites and on recreating assets.

## Arrange your Code
Next is how you arrange your code. The repository this site is built from has a readme.md that points me first to where I need to be going. A readme at the root is standard. Update it with where you're going and where you need to be when you've been doing something else for nine months.

The readme here reminds me that, if I'm reading it again, either I'm browsing the github repo or I need the reminder that I need to be in /docs/ like I decided a long time ago. I've also pulled in links from the welcome-to-jekyll post. That way  as soon as I get back in here and need to jog my memory about whether I'm working in jekyll, mkdocs, or something else, I've got the start.

Also, set up your 404 with a link to the main page. That way you and others are never all the way lost but only a click from home.
