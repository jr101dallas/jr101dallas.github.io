# Preparation
Maybe you're already years into your business, maybe just starting, but the time to prepare is now. Unless intend to stay small, and I'm not knocking that, you need a plan, a strategy, for scale.

## People and Training
The one thing you can't duplicate is you. Lots of talk around entrepreneurship is how you spend your time. Whether the strategy is Eisenhower boxes or something else, things that need to be done may still overwhelm the amount of time you have in a day. That means that greater success is available if you can train people to do what you do.

## Time Efficient Training
You already know that time is the one thing you can't spare. Hiring a new person and training them takes your time. You can either use a crystal ball and hire early enough or you end up training when you really can't afford to spen the time.

Minimize your training time. When you write your breadcrumbs, leave an extra sentence, or a few more words than you need. Just one minute, or a few seconds worth, of extra breadcrumb in your code can cut training time drastically. Teach your new hires that you leave breadcrumbs in the readme and they'll start looking there first before asking you the next question. Links to quickstarts on the tools you're using, notes on your class names or architecture, business philosophy and market strategy, even when these things aren't pretty and polished they save time.
