# Last Item
The last work item I have on my list is maybe a little nonsensical at this point. Pick up an item from where? Drop an item, sure, no problem, I just don't worry about where it goes, set the variable to null and it goes to the garbage collector.  

- adding and removing Items from Inventory

Maybe I should just drop that work item for now. Maybe just delay it for a while, put it in my breadcrumbs and wait till it makes sense. In the trivial sense I can already add and remove items from the Dictionary in Inventory anyway.  

## Reviewing
I've got a pile of things that I've mentioned here and there that I need to cordinate into breadcrumbs.  

- messages for lots of things that would show in Watcher
- magic string eliminiation
- refactoring to single purpose, etc.
- setting random seed at startup
- summary component or system
- item theft
- research games that allow setting the random seed
- inventory management system for effects that happen to all items

## Informing Plan
I'll need to take these and take a look back at my breadcrumbs to work out my next steps. I'm curious and thinking about the "other games and random seed" thing so I may go chase that for a bit. Planning what I'm doing next is where I'm at though. The review and updating of my breadcrumbs will help keep me in mind of the bigger picture as I plan out the smaller pieces and finally code the detail steps.
