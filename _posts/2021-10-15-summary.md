# Roguelike Plan
Summarizing where I am for the rogueliks tutorial has gotten me a decent plan for where I'm headed. It has its own [breadcrumbs](/roguelike-tutorial/breadcrumbs/).  

## Next Step
I'm really out of time for tonight but at least I'm in a good situation for actual coding tomorrow. Looking at ECS and having an Entity, I need to plumb in my Components. Looking at a Dictionary of Components, should be plenty fast to start and by the time it's too slow I'll have other problems to worry about. With an Entity and a list of Components, I'll be able to make some decisions on what kind of Components I need to start with. I've got combat interaction at the top of the list so maybe I'll start off with something that has everything that a System will need for resolving an attack. We'll at least get a start to it.  

## Procrastinate
I need to go small. I won't have much time and it flies past. Good thing I need to quit for the night; I can stew on how to cut off a small enough chunk and still have it be valuable to deliver. This is going to be tough this close to the beginning.
