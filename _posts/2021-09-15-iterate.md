# Behind
We never end up with enough breadcrumbs for training. Part of the reason is still that you can't duplicate yourself. Other people don't have your experience, your thought process, your frame of mind, and the breadcrumbs you left need more detail, more links, more words, etc.

## Strategy
One thing that your next new hire can do right from the start is expand the breadcrumbs. If each person you train adds to the breadcrumbs, pretty soon someone might call them documentation, eventually, maybe even training materials. Use the "less efficient" new hire time on writing down what you're teaching them. Review the product (pull requests are great here) to confirm understanding and help increase clarity on jargon and company knowledge. And now the next hire starts a step closer to a training program than the last.

## Iterate
When each new hire adds to the training materials, the last hire increases their depth of understanding by being the trainer. You are less involved because your knowledge is alreay being documented and passed on and your seasoned employees step into more responsibility naturally because they are the recent experts in the documentation. Watch changes to your training documentation, readme files, and breadcrumbs. These save you the most time in your company of any tool available and there's no way to buy them from a vendor.
