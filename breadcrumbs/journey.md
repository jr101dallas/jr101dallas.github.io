# Journey
Part changelog and part future training tool, these are rough steps on how I've gotten to where I am now on this project. The First Steps section is basically just the history of getting this site up and not completely broken. Other sections are to be discovered as the journey continues.

## First Steps
Make a user website on github pages.
* New Repository on github
* Enable Github Pages in repository settings
* Choose a theme -- tactile
* Change build folder /docs [wrong turn here](/github-pages-types) caused missing navbar below, and confusion
* Create /docs folder and this README.md
* Customize 404 to get back to main in case of problems
* Customize About and License
* Move useful links from Welcome to Jekyll into readme for breadcrumbs
* Implement the posts page from the Jekyll docs
* Mess about with ```--future``` and ```--drafts``` arguments
* Troubleshoot local render difference from github render, missing navbar [solution here](/github-pages-types)
* Reorganize to straighten out Home Page, confusion, etc.
* Add new 'important' pages to navbar
