# Breadcrumb Strategy
This is my example and working breadcrumbs page. It's public so that you can see what's going on and so you can see the kinds of things I really put in my breadcrumbs instead of something faked or mocked.

Breadcrumbs are my way of getting back to where I need to be after having been distracted (perpetually) or really sidetracked, as I was for nine months before finally getting back to this project. When I did come back, these digital breadcrumbs were sitting in my repository, checked in, versioned in case I ever need to look back, and reasonably safe from birds. I also talk more about [Following Breadcrumbs](/following-breadcrumbs) if you're curious.

## Bookmark TODO
Stuff that I know I need to do and actually wrote down, instead of investigating GitHub Issues or setting up Jira.
* TODO: Figure out spelling and grammar checking, I'm honest enough to know I need it and vain enough to want to look good, professional, call it professional
* TODO: navbar styling for multi-word links is unclear that it's a single entry and spacing is a little tight
* TODO: summarize CI/CD ramble posts into a decent how-to on setting thigs up
* TODO: tag posts as I pull together summaries
* TODO: plan steps on Roguelike Tutorial
* TODO: browse for preventing problems https://blog.webjeda.com/tags/
* TODO: category pages once scanning posts is done

## Quickstart Notes if you kinda Remember
Static site in Jekyll, if you're viewing this page you're either:  
* running Jekyll locally ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` and looking for [local build url](http://127.0.0.1:4000)
* and you probably want the switches ```--future --drafts```
***OR***
* You're possibly on assumeforsimplicity.com and curious, maybe about breadcrumbs.
