<p>Revenue is job one. Revenue goes first or the company is gone.<br />
<em>Fast</em> serves <strong>new contract</strong> revenue.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“After we deliver on the contract and get paid, we can put in 
the logging we know we’ll need, 
work on the performance, 
write the documentation….”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Service companies stay there, <em>Fast</em> with new contracts as king.</p>

<p>Product companies have to <em>transition</em>.<br />
<strong>Monthly Recurring Revenue</strong> (MRR) starts to challenge new contracts for priority, revenue is more secure, which leads to growth, hiring, and support.</p>

<p>What’s to <em>transition</em>?<br />
Growth weighs down <em>fast</em> code requiring performance work, maybe new architecture.<br />
Hiring requires training, sharing knowledge, meetings.<br />
Support of MRR needs prevention, stability, testing, monitoring, coordination.</p>

<p>The transition to growth, from <em>Services</em> to <em>Product</em>, is about tackling the balance between <em>fast</em> and <em>scale</em>, between <em>writing</em> software and <em>supporting</em> software. This website is dedicated to that balance, fast <em>enough</em> and scalable <em>enough</em> on the way through 10x growth to 1,000,000x growth.</p>
