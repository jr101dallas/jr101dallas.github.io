<h1 id="crystal-ball">Crystal Ball</h1>
<p>Thinking out toward a roguelike game and trying to put into Components and Systems some of the things I think I want to have happen in the game, I think to start I’m going to put Entity conflict into its own Component and System. For the moment, I think that means that all the stuff like hit points, armor, damage resistance, weapon, damage amount and type, all goes into a Component that’s basically just Combat. I’m second guessing myself as I write this, but I think I’m going to go farward in this direction for a while until I start seeing how my Systems start shaping up.</p>

<h2 id="combat-component">Combat Component</h2>
<p>Listing out some things that I think I’ll end up wanting to have happen in the game will help me flesh out the work items I’m going to hang on the bare bones ideas I have so far.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ablation of damage and wearing out of related items</li>
  <li>missing attacks due to high armor or dodge or illusion</li>
  <li>injury</li>
  <li>fatigue</li>
  <li>damage resistance by damage types</li>
  <li>temporary bonuses</li>
  <li>innate permanent bonuses</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simmering">Simmering</h2>
<p>I’ll let that list simmer for a bit and see if I think of anything else that I need to plan ahead on. In the meantime I probably also need to come up with a list of other things that I need to have in components because it will help me figure out what belongs in which component. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>combat, as above</li>
  <li>inventory</li>
  <li>communication? maybe reactions?</li>
  <li>skills? maybe several separate skills?</li>
  <li>relationships, maybe that’s part of reactions</li>
  <li>locomotion</li>
  <li>knowledge, discovered information</li>
  <li>conditions, maybe not, keeping these with the things they affect seems better except for reporting on a heads-up display</li>
  <li>heads-up display</li>
  <li>stats, tallies per entity could be fun</li>
</ul>

<p>That stirs up some ideas!</p>
