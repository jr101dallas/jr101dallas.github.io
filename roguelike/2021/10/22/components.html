<h1 id="combat-component">Combat Component</h1>
<p>I didn’t think of anything where I have a conflict with a combat component. So far, that seems like a chunk of data that hangs together and would be everything that a system that cares about resolving hits and damage would need. I’ll run with it and see where we end up.</p>

<h2 id="function-to-code">Function to Code</h2>
<p>Repeating the list from before:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ablation of damage and wearing out of related items</li>
  <li>missing attacks due to high armor or dodge or illusion</li>
  <li>injury</li>
  <li>fatigue</li>
  <li>damage resistance by damage types</li>
  <li>temporary bonuses</li>
  <li>innate permanent bonuses</li>
</ul>

<p>I need to break out some pieces of code, classes, properties, methods. I’ll need some of these at least:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Properties
    <ul>
      <li>int for hit points, how much damage before the entity is removed from the play area</li>
      <li>int for causing misses</li>
      <li>int for targeting</li>
      <li>int for bursts of activity vs. constant motion</li>
      <li>int for bonuses and penalties for each</li>
      <li>enum for damage types</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Yikes, there’s a lot there. Maybe I can group some stuff out into classes. Even if this is one System that works on these, multiple classes may be a good idea.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classes
    <ul>
      <li>hit points, damage adjustments, calculations, and types</li>
      <li>targeting</li>
      <li>hit resolution</li>
      <li>burst activity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so bringing in some methods on the classes might look like this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Targeting, figuring origin entity stats
    <ul>
      <li>TargetAtRange</li>
      <li>TargetAdjacent</li>
      <li>TargetArea</li>
      <li>AimCarefully</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Defending, figuring target entity stats
    <ul>
      <li>CheckImmunities, maybe an attack type is ignored</li>
      <li>CheckDodge, maybe really hard to hit or really easy</li>
      <li>CheckAblation, maybe armor is damaged and reduces or negates damage totals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Injury (and healing)
    <ul>
      <li>Injure(type, amount)</li>
      <li>Heal(amount)</li>
      <li>AdjustForType(type, amount)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stuff-to-do">Stuff to Do</h2>
<p>I’ve got lists of stuff, concepts. If I start with the simplest case out of all that then it probably looks something like Entity1 targets Entity2 and Entity2 gets removed from the play area. That seems like a decent bite sized chunk so I’ll go for it.</p>
