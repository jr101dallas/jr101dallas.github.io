<h1 id="well-begun">Well Begun</h1>
<p>The first steps are up. For those who aren’t used to C#, I’ll be a little too wordy for the people who are. I’ve created a solution (container) and a project (main) and a test project (main-test); those aren’t their real names. I’ve added the projects to the solution, added a reference in main-test back to main so that the tests can actually hit the code under test, and then wrote a little nothing code so that I can write a little nothing test and make sure that I can build and run tests. Voila!</p>

<h2 id="other-tutorials">Other Tutorials</h2>
<p>Because the focus of my project is to demonstrate a method, an algorithm, for sustained momentum in a coding project and not to teach what other people have already done, and done well, the best thing I can do is to also provide links to tutorials that cover the things that I’m skipping. Therefore, this Micorsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest">tutorial</a> is what you really want if you need to know how to get started creating solutions, projects, and test projects. It also has a little primer on how to use mstest.</p>

<h2 id="stay-on-the-path">Stay On the Path</h2>
<p>Some people may ask, “Really, mstest? Why not NUnit?” Truth be told, I don’t have a lot of preference for which testing framework you use, just make sure you’re using one, and pick one that LOTS of people use. And, pick one that LOTS of people use with YOUR language. The really important thing is, time. You’ll hear me say it a lot. Time. You’ll save a ton of time, especailly over the life of an entire project, by using tools that “the internet” knows about. When a lot of people use a tool, they write posts, and create issues with the help desk, and talk in the forums about it. This means other people are probably having the problem you’ll have next week. Probably only one in one hundred people will post about it, and you need thousands of people so that you’re not searching for the ONE page on the internet that will help you. Stay on the path, the grass is beaten down, and the way forward is clear.</p>
