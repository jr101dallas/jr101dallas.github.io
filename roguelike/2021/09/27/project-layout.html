<h1 id="requirements-to-organization">Requirements to Organization</h1>
<p>Looking at my requirements, keeping things simple and fast is the big trick. Being able to work on a small section of code at a time will help a lot. To me, this means a few things. One is that I need to keep things in a model that I understand well rather than trying to conform to someone else’s thought process.</p>

<h2 id="library-facade-projects">Library Facade Projects</h2>
<p>The packages I’m going to be using, I’m almost certainly going to want to build a layer of logic around so that I’m calling code that makes sense to me. If I’m using a library that serves breakfast, I want to make calls like “fry eggs” or “set table” instead of things like “set table height to 5” and “set egg flip time to 97 seconds.” That means I want my dependency on a seperate project that wraps the library. In this case, I need to take a look again at the <a href="https://sadconsole.com/">SadConsole</a> <a href="https://github.com/Chris3606/GoRogue">GoRogue</a> <a href="https://github.com/thesadrogue/SadConsole.GoRogueHelpers">helpers</a> to see if I’m going to have one wrapping project on that, or if I’m going to have separate projects for the two libraries separately.</p>

<h2 id="test-projects">Test Projects</h2>
<p>Tests will also help keep my total context load and switching small. With good and plentiful tests I don’t have to think quite as much about all the dominoes I’m about to knock over. I can just swing for the fence and watch to see what happens in the tests. If everything turns red, maybe I need to reconsider, or maybe I just need to follow the thread where it leads and fix the code and fix the tests as I go. Either way, I know immediately much more about the details of my decision without having to build it all in my thought palace first.</p>
