<h1 id="last-item">Last Item</h1>
<p>The last work item I have on my list is maybe a little nonsensical at this point. Pick up an item from where? Drop an item, sure, no problem, I just don’t worry about where it goes, set the variable to null and it goes to the garbage collector.</p>

<ul>
  <li>adding and removing Items from Inventory</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I should just drop that work item for now. Maybe just delay it for a while, put it in my breadcrumbs and wait till it makes sense. In the trivial sense I can already add and remove items from the Dictionary in Inventory anyway.</p>

<h2 id="reviewing">Reviewing</h2>
<p>I’ve got a pile of things that I’ve mentioned here and there that I need to cordinate into breadcrumbs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>messages for lots of things that would show in Watcher</li>
  <li>magic string eliminiation</li>
  <li>refactoring to single purpose, etc.</li>
  <li>setting random seed at startup</li>
  <li>summary component or system</li>
  <li>item theft</li>
  <li>research games that allow setting the random seed</li>
  <li>inventory management system for effects that happen to all items</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informing-plan">Informing Plan</h2>
<p>I’ll need to take these and take a look back at my breadcrumbs to work out my next steps. I’m curious and thinking about the “other games and random seed” thing so I may go chase that for a bit. Planning what I’m doing next is where I’m at though. The review and updating of my breadcrumbs will help keep me in mind of the bigger picture as I plan out the smaller pieces and finally code the detail steps.</p>
