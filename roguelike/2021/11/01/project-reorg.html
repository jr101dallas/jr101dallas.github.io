<h1 id="class-library">Class Library</h1>
<p>In building the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">physics</code> project originally, I opted for a console project. As I kept building, I came more and more to the realization that I’m working on a class library and not a console app at all. How to correct the problem? I solved it with some messing around with the dotnet cli and some copy/paste magic.</p>

<h2 id="building-sideways">Building Sideways</h2>
<p>I switched to a different folder and “started over” so that I could see clearly what the raw dotnet commands produced. I did the following:</p>

<div class="language-powershell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">sln</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">-n</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Utopia</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">classlib</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">-n</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Physics</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">-n</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Watcher</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">mstest</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">-n</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">PhysicsTests</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">sln</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nx">\Physics\Physics.csproj</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">sln</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nx">\PhysicsTests\PhysicsTests.csproj</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">sln</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nx">\Watcher\Watcher.csproj</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">cd</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nx">\Watcher\</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">reference</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="nx">\Physics\Physics.csproj</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">cd</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="w"> 
</span><span class="n">cd</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nx">\PhysicsTests\</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">dotnet</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">reference</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="nx">\Physics\Physics.csproj</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once I could see the files created, I replaced the ones in my real repository folder and started cleaning up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the old physics.cs is actually the new Program.cs in Watcher with the original Hello World! in it</li>
  <li>physicstests.cs goes away since I’m not ready to create a test project for Watcher yet</li>
  <li>I went ahead and renamed things like utopia to Utopia and physics to Physics</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I thought I was done, I tried out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dotnet test</code> again and also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dotnet run -p .\Watcher\Watcher.csproj</code>. I can definitely say that I didn’t have everything right on the first try, don’t think it was totally simple. On the other hand, the errors I got along the way were mostly clear. Once I looked at the files they were pointing at and what the command was that I was trying to run, mostly it registered what I’d done wrong and needed to fix.</p>

<h2 id="good-design">Good Design</h2>
<p>Some luck helped along with a the strategy above of comparing to something that worked the way I wanted. But also, the style of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.csproj</code> files that come with the dotnet cli helped a bunch too. The fact that there aren’t references to every included file made it simple to drop in the new sln and csproj files and have things still mostly work. I wouldn’t have been able to do that with the old Visual Studio generated files. Things are getting easier all over.</p>
