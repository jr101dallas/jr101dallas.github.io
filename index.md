# Growing
When I started with this project, my user GitHub Pages, I was planning to write a lot about business. I'm still planning to do that, but I've gotten side tracked some in the details of getting things really up and running on less than an hour a day.  

Right now, in Oct. 2021, I'm a calendar month or so into the project, closing in on one work-week of work time. If you're laughing, you probably know what I mean. But, that also means that I'm not the only person out there trying to put together a project on little time and trying to keep focus and be efficient, THAT is the main point of this site.  

## Side projects
As part of the same idea, I'm working on putting together a [roguelike game and tutorial](/roguelike-tutorial/), not to demonstrate the normal things like Object Oriented Programming (OOP) or the libraries I'm using, but to demonstrate a method. If I can get this project going on an hour a day, not lose track, not burn out, and keep momentum, then I'll have a great basis for the theory I'm trying to display. That arranging your work and habits decently can keep you on track for your business __even though you don't have time__, which is the reality when you're growing your business.  

Along the way, I'm jabbering my way through my work in the [blog](/posts/) and realizing that although some people will find that interesting and entertaining, others will be wanting a distilled versions of certain aspects of the journey, like how I've got the website set up. That's a future project at the moment but it may be a near future one since I think I've finally got it where I need it to be so that my __life__ runs the way it needs to run and the __website__ runs the way it needs to run even though those two things are completely different in schedule and regularity.  

## Organization
See [Breadcrumbs](/breadcrumbs/) if you're just trying to figure out what's supposed to be happening or [Following Breadcrumbs](/business/2021/09/12/following-breadcrumbs.html) if you want to see some blather on "What the heck? Breadcrumbs?"  

See [Journey](/breadcrumbs/journey.html) if you like looking back over what it took to get here.  

Or, feel free to rummage around in [Posts](/posts/) for spare change and the like.
