# Totally Brilliant
When I started with this project, my user GitHub Pages, I was a little confused about User/Organization GitHub Pages versus Project GitHub Pages. That meant that I'd originally planned for this to be my normal README at the root of my repository rather than my Home Page.  

Then, I learned better. Now, I'll eventually figure out how I want to present my totally awesome and exquisitely brilliant Home Page and repository readme combo document, but for not you get this.

## Organization
See [Breadcrumbs](/breadcrumbs/) if you're just trying to figure out what's supposed to be happening or [Following Breadcrumbs](following-breadcrumbs) if you want to see some blather on "What the heck? Breadcrumbs?"  

See [Journey](/breadcrumbs/journey.html) if you like looking back over what it took to get here.  

Or, feel free to rummage around in [Posts](/posts/) for spare change and the like.
